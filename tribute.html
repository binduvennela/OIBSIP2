<h2>A brief summary of APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>
    APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, on October 15, 1931.
     His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen, was an imam of a local mosque and a boat owner.
      He was the youngest in the family with four elder brothers and a sister.
    Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere that was 
    full of love and compassion. In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers during his early years.   
    He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard working.
     He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from 
     ‘Schwartz Higher Secondary School,’ and then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli,’ in 1954.
      He wanted to become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight positions available 
      in the IAF and he secured the ninth place..</p>

<h3>Career<br>

    As A Scientist</h3>
<p>
    In 1960, he graduated from the ‘Madras Institute of Technology,’ and joined as a scientist at the ‘Aeronautical Development 
    Establishment,’ after becoming a member of the ‘Defence Research and Development Service.’ Kalam also worked under the eminent
     space scientist Vikram Sarabhai while he was a part of ‘INCOSPAR’ committee. Kalam was transferred to the ‘Indian Space Research 
     Organization (ISRO)’ in 1969. He became the project head of the country’s foremost Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III).
      In July 1980, SLV-III deployed the ‘Rohini’ satellite successfully near-earth orbit under Kalam’s leadership.
    Kalam was a part of a number of projects, including ‘Project Devil,’ in 1970. Though the project was not successful, yet 
    it laid the foundation for the development of the ‘Prithvi Missile,’ in 1980. He was also associated with ‘Project Valiant.’   
    In 1983, Kalam returned to DRDO as its chief as he was asked to lead the ‘Integrated Guided Missile Development Program’ (IGMDP).  
    In May 1998, he played a key role in carrying out ‘Porkhran-II’ nuclear tests by India. The success of these nuclear tests made 
    Kalam a national hero and his popularity went skyrocketing.   
    As a technical visionary, he made several recommendations in the fields of technological innovations, agriculture, and nuclear energy to make India a developed nation by 2020.</p>
<h3>As President</h3>
<p>
    In 2002, Kalam was chosen the Presidential nominee by the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and he was elected 
    the President. He became the 11th President of India on July 25, 2002 and served the position till July 25, 2007.
    He also became the third President of India to have received ‘Bharat Ratna’ before assuming the office of the President.    
    Due to his style of working and interaction with common people, especially the youth, he was affectionately called ‘The People’s 
    President.’ According to Dr. Kalam, the most arduous decision he had taken during his tenure was that of signing the ‘Office of
     Profit Bill.’   
    During his tenure as President, he faced criticism for his inaction in deciding the fate of mercy petitions that were 
    submitted to him. Out of the 21 mercy petitions, he acted only on one mercy plea. In 2005, he recommended for President’s 
    rule in Bihar, which also became a controversial decision.</p>
<h3>Awards and Achievements</h3>
<p>
    Kalam was honoured with the prestigious ‘Bharat Ratan,’ ‘Padma Vibhushan,’ and ‘Padma Bhushan’ from the Government of India.<br>
    He was bestowed upon the ‘Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration’ by the Government of India in 1997.<br>
    He was the recipient of Veer Savarkar Award.<br>
    In 2000, he was bestowed with ‘Ramanujan Award’ by the ‘Alwars Research Centre.’<br>
    In 2007, he received the ‘Kings Charles II Medal’ from the Royal Society.<br>
    The ASME Foundation, USA, honoured Kalam with the Hoover Medal.<br>
    He also received honorary doctorate from 40 universities.<br>
    The United Nations recognized Kalam’s 79th birthday as World Students’ Day.<br>
    In 2003 and 2006, he was nominated for the ‘MTV Youth Icon of the Year.’

<h3>His Writings</h3>
<p>
    Dr Kalam authored and co-authored a number of instructional and inspirational books, including ‘India 2020: A Vision for the New

<h3>Death</h3>
<p>
    Kalam went to IIM Shillong to deliver a lecture on ‘Creating a Livable Planet Earth,’ on July 27, 2015.
     While climbing a flight of stairs, he expressed some discomfort, but made his way to the auditorium. 
     Only five minutes into the lecture, around 6:35pm IST, he collapsed in the lecture hall. He was taken to ‘Bethany Hospital’ 
     in a critical condition. He was kept in the intensive care unit but lacked signs of life. At 7:45pm IST, he was declared dead
      due to cardiac arrest.
    Kalam’s body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter and was flown to New Delhi on July 28. Numerous dignitaries 
    and masses paid homage to him at his residence at 10 Rajaji Marg. Kalam’s body, wrapped in the national flag, was then flown 
    to the town of Mandapam, from where an army truck took it to his home town of Rameswaram. His body was displayed at Rameswaram 
    in front of a bus station to allow people to pay their last respect to the departed soul. On July 30, 2015, the former President
     was laid to rest with full state honours at Rameswaram’s Pei Karumbu Ground. Kalam’s last rites were attended by more than 350,000
      people.</p>
